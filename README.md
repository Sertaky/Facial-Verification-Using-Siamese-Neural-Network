# Facial-Verification-Using-Siamese-Neural-Network
Developed a facial verification system leveraging Siamese Neural Networks.  


## Project Overview
This project implements a facial verification system using Siamese Neural Networks to compare two images and determine their similarity. The system is trained to distinguish between pairs of facial images using deep learning techniques.

## Features
- Facial image preprocessing and augmentation.
- Twin neural networks for feature extraction.
- Robust verification using contrastive loss.

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV
- **Environment**: Google Colab

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone <repository-link>
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook facial_verification.ipynb
